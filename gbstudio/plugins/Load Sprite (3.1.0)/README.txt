Description-
This plugin loads a sprite into memory in the current scene.
It does not compile to any GBVM instructions.
It only tells the GBS compiler to include the sprite in the current scene.
The sprite can then be referenced by engine code, such as when dynamically loading projectiles.

Installation instructions-
Create a folder called 'plugins' inside the root folder of your GB Studio project.
Add the 'Load Sprite' folder that contains this readme file to the 'plugins' folder.
Reopen your project in GB Studio and compile your game.
